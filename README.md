# SecureIoTOS üõ°Ô∏è

**A Rust-based Secure Tiny OS for ARM Cortex-M IoT Devices**

[![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/rust-nightly-orange.svg)](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

## Overview

SecureIoTOS is a **bare-metal operating system for ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers**, written in Rust.
It demonstrates **secure boot, memory protection, process isolation, safe drivers, cryptography, and secure communication** for IoT devices.

The repository provides fully modular source code and examples to **build, run, and test the OS** on both QEMU and real IoT boards like STM32, ESP32, and NRF52.

## Why SecureIoTOS written in Rust Instead of C/C++
[![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-language-blue.svg)](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

SecureIoTOS is written in Rust to leverage **modern safety, security, and productivity benefits** that are harder to achieve in C/C++. Here are the main reasons:

1. **Memory Safety Without a Garbage Collector** ‚Äì Rust prevents dangling pointers, buffer overflows, and use-after-free errors via ownership and borrowing.  
2. **Fearless Concurrency** ‚Äì Rust‚Äôs type system ensures no data races at compile time.  
3. **No Undefined Behavior by Default** ‚Äì Rust makes potential memory and logic errors explicit.  
4. **Zero-Cost Abstractions** ‚Äì High-level code runs as efficiently as C/C++.  
5. **Safer Embedded Development** ‚Äì Memory safety reduces firmware crashes and vulnerabilities.  
6. **Better Package & Dependency Management** ‚Äì Cargo simplifies building, testing, and dependency handling.  
7. **Modern Language Features** ‚Äì Pattern matching, enums, traits, async/await, macros, and more reduce boilerplate.  
8. **Security by Design** ‚Äì Rust reduces common IoT vulnerabilities originating from memory corruption in C/C++.  
9. **Growing Embedded Ecosystem** ‚Äì `embedded-hal`, RTIC, and HAL crates make Rust practical for IoT development.  
10. **Developer Productivity & Maintainability** ‚Äì Strong compiler guarantees reduce debugging and long-term maintenance costs.  

In short, **Rust combines the performance of C with the safety of modern languages**, making it ideal for security-critical IoT operating systems like SecureIoTOS.
