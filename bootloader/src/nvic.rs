/// This function is intended to:

/// - Enable or disable specific interrupt lines.
/// - Configure priority grouping if needed.

/// At present this is a placeholder; the actual implementation will depend

/// Initialize the SysTick timer.
///
/// This function is intended to:
/// - Configure the SysTick reload value.
/// - Set the interrupt priority for SysTick.
/// - Enable SysTick interrupts and start the counter.
///
/// SysTick is often used for generating periodic ticks (e.g., for an RTOS
/// scheduler or system heartbeat). The implementation should be adjusted
/// based on the clock source and desired tick frequency.
